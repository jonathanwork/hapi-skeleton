browser-sync starter kit with hapi js
=====================================

very simple to use you just have to have gulp installed in global mode
since it relies on it

run this commands to install

    npm install --global gulp

up next install the packages

    npm install

that should be it. the folder structure is very basic
source is ofcourse the pug files and the sass files.
they compile up to app folder.
if you run bower make sure you do it inside of the app folder too install your js libs.

cool that should be it enjoy hapi-skeleton
